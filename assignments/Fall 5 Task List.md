## Assignment #5 Task List

We would like to use an agile approach to manage our project. We are creating multiple epics, and planning out a more detailed list of tasks for our first sprint. 

We will be using Trello to keep track of our tasks. Each board will be an epic. Every card within a board will be a task that can be assigned to a primary team member.
