Project Background Description

* The Hour of Code is a global computer science education movement that Code.org started in 2013. Since then, it has engaged over 100 million students around the world in 45 different languages. During Hour of Code activities, females make up 50% of all participants. All activities are gathered on hourofcode.com/learn. During Computer Science Education week which is always the first week in December, these activities must be free, self guided, about an hour long, and must not require students to log in. 

Project Problem Statement

* Computer science education, especially for young children is important because it teaches valuable life skills and engages everyone, no matter their background, preventing stereotypes from forming. We will use our technical and education experience to create an Hour of Code activity that engages students with music. Music apps like music.ly have recently been very popular with kids, so tying music into computer science will hopefully be very engaging. 

Inadequacy of Current Solutions

* Many of the current Hour of Code activities very similar- students take the role of a main character and must program each step the character takes to reach the goal. There are many variations of this type of activity. A music-based activity will break out of this mold and allow students to be more creative with computer science concepts.

Background skills applicable to the problem

* Two of our team members have worked for computer science education organizations, including a local after school program in Cincinnati and the Code.org headquarters. All four of our members have web development knowledge, covering both back and front end. 

Team approach, goals, and expectations

* We intend to follow the [Hour of Code activity guidelines](https://hourofcode.com/us/activity-guidelines) outlined by Code.org in order to get it submitted as an actual lesson plan used during Computer Science Education Week in 2019.
