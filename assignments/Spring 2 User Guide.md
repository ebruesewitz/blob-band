# Getting Started

Music Machines is an Hour of Code activity to teach the computer science concept of loops through music. There is a progression of 10 levels throughout the activity. Hour of Code activities are designed to be self guided so that students can complete levels at their own pace.

## Step One:

Visit [our website](https://blobband.com) to access the Music Machines game. If our activity gets chosen as an official Hour of Code, it will also be accessible at https://hourofcode.com/us/learn. 

## Step Two: 

Press "Let's get started!" and follow the instructions on each level.

## Step Four: 

Click the "Run" button to start the music machines! The play area will be populated with animations that react to the music that you created!


## FAQ

Q: What if students need help?
A: Each level has a hint button in case students need some help! 


Q: What is the Hour of Code?
A: The Hour of Code is a global computer science education movement that Code.org started in 2013. Since then, it has engaged over 100 million students around the world in 45 different languages. During Hour of Code activities, females make up 50% of all participants. Hourofcode.com hosts a variety of hour-long, self-guided activities.


Q: What is Blob Band?
A: Our Hour of Code engages 2nd and 3rd grade students in computer science through music. It allows them to express themselves creatively by composing new songs while learning computer science concepts such as sequences and loops. Blob characters react to each note played.


Q: What is the impact of our project?
A: Many of the current Hour of Code activities are very similarâ€”students take the role of a main character and must program each step the character takes to reach the goal. A music-based activity will break out of this mold and allow students to be more creative.


Q: What were the challenges of our project?
A: Designing an age appropriate and engaging curriculum following CS education standards
Creating and implementing custom animations and sounds using Lottie and React components
Forking Scratch 3.0, stripping everything but the toolbox/workspace, and creating custom blocks


Q: What was accomplished?
A: Created a 10 level, hour long self guided curriculum in a React web app with modern UI/UX and animations. The activity will be submitted for approval for the official 2019 Hour of Code website.
